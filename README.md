# HIV Burden and Multidimensional Poverty Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project investigates the global burden of HIV and its relationship with multidimensional poverty. By combining epidemiological data with World Bank development indicators, it aims to identify patterns and socioeconomic drivers of HIV prevalence across countries and WHO regions.

This is a **proposal-stage analytical project**, outlining a comprehensive plan for future analysis and modeling. It is intended to showcase applied data science skills while addressing a real-world global health issue.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize global HIV trends, with a focus on countries contributing to 75% of global cases.
- Examine regional trends in HIV prevalence across WHO regions from 2000 to 2023.
- Merge HIV data with World Bank indicators of multidimensional poverty.
- Use mixed-effects regression models to explore the relationship between HIV and poverty factors such as income, education, and sanitation.

## 🧪 Methodology (Planned)

1. **Data Acquisition & Cleaning**
   - Load and clean HIV prevalence data.
   - Standardize and preprocess poverty indicator data.
   - Merge datasets on common fields.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Rank countries by HIV prevalence.
   - Plot bar charts and time series to visualize trends.
   - Create geospatial maps to show HIV distribution.

3. **Modeling**
   - Mixed-effects linear regression using poverty indicators as predictors.
   - Include random effects for country and year.

## 📈 Key Insights (Expected)

- Certain countries consistently bear a disproportionate share of global HIV cases.
- Multidimensional poverty is expected to be positively associated with HIV prevalence.
- Education and sanitation likely play significant roles in disease outcomes.

## 🔍 Future Additions

- Formal residual analysis and model validation.
- Sensitivity analysis by poverty dimension.
- Time-based testing of top 75% contributor stability.
- Expanded policy recommendations based on findings.
